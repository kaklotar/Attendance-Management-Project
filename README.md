# Attendance-Management-Project
Hello everyone,
  
  I am feeling glad to see you here so, let me clear that what and why i have made this project.

  Firstly, in my 5th sem of bca(bachelor of computer application) our collage professor told us to make mini project from what we learn,
  so after researching a lot i come out to with an amazing idea to solve some basic day to day life problem for some small business or school,
  which is attendance where many new businesses with small amount of staff they have to record all the detail and schedule of their staff as well as in schools teacher's have to not down all the student attendance in the paper sheet on     
  daily bases so, as i remember my past scool life some time teacher forget to bring their attendance record sheet at home or sometime it get lost, and thats creat very problamatic situation, after thinking about all of this i made this      small level project from what i learn and i tried my best to make it.
  
  In addition, in this project i make a simple attendance management system is usefull for any kind of people who want to check the how many people are present or absent in any kind 
  of field.

  Application Details....

    Front End.
      - XML
      - JAVA

    Back End.
